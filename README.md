## Features of this project

ðŸš€ I've implemented an authentication system using Firebase, enabling users to register and log in to their accounts securely.

ðŸš€ Additionally, I've incorporated the functionality for users to log in with their other social accounts, such as Google and GitHub.

ðŸš€ I've implemented JWT token authentication for user verification.

ðŸš€ Furthermore, I've implemented a private route concept to restrict access to specific routes unless users are logged in to their accounts, ensuring enhanced security and privacy.

ðŸš€ On the homepage, I've showcased some top selling foods loaded from a MongoDB database.

ðŸš€ I've added routes for adding and updating food, providing users with the ability to contribute to the database and keep information up-to-date.

ðŸš€ I've implemented a route for each food displayed, allowing users to access comprehensive information about a specific food when they click the "View Details" button.

ðŸš€ Within the food details route, users can find detailed information about the specific food.

ðŸš€ Additionally, I've introduced a route named 'My List' where users can view the spots they have added in tabular form. They also have the option to delete any spots they have added to their list, offering a seamless user experience.
