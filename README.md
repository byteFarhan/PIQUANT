## Features of this project

ğŸš€ I've implemented an authentication system using Firebase, enabling users to register and log in to their accounts securely.

ğŸš€ Additionally, I've incorporated the functionality for users to log in with their other social accounts, such as Google and GitHub.

ğŸš€ Furthermore, I've implemented a private route concept to restrict access to specific routes unless users are logged in to their accounts, ensuring enhanced security and privacy.

ğŸš€ On the homepage, I've showcased some top selling foods loaded from a MongoDB database.

ğŸš€ I've added routes for adding and updating food, providing users with the ability to contribute to the database and keep information up-to-date.

ğŸš€ I've implemented a route for each food displayed, allowing users to access comprehensive information about a specific food when they click the "View Details" button.

ğŸš€ Within the food details route, users can find detailed information about the specific food.

ğŸš€ Additionally, I've introduced a route named 'My List' where users can view the spots they have added in tabular form. They also have the option to delete any spots they have added to their list, offering a seamless user experience.
